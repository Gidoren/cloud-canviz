#My Contributions

I Developed image uploading on the backend in Node.js. I used AWS to store images in s3 buckets and stored the image url onto our Mongo database. The site would fetch the images through the URL stored in our database. I also worked on some of the server backend functions for modifying and adding liked images and users that liked artists. I containerized the applications front end and back end with docker and docker compose. I also developed the tests with tangfarris to test the graphql queries.
